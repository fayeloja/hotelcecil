            Diplomats were equally keen to use the hotel's facilities. Just over a year after Prince Henri d'Orleans visit, in June 1901, the French residents of Tangier chose the Cecil as the venue for an early version of the cocktail party. It was given in honour of their Ambassador:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "On Monday night a 'punch d'honneur' was offered by the French residents to His Excellency Monsieur Révoil, which was also attended by Rear-Admiral Caillard, the officers of the two French cruisers in port, and the personnel of the French Legation. The kiosk of the Hotel Cecil, were the refreshment was served was decorated with French Flags, flowers and green foliage, and the band of the cruiser Pothau played at intervals. Patriotic speeches of congratulations and a hearty farewell were given to the Minister, and responded to by His Excellency."

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The early twentieth century, when almost all of the European powers were monarchies, was an era during when many diplomats were coincidentally aristocrats, as exemplified by <span className="font-semibold">His Excellency the Duque de Tovar</span>, Grandee of Spain and that country's Ambassador to the Holy See, who was a guest at the Cecil in May 1908.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Even the representatives of the world's brashest and most proselytizing republic, the United States of America, were enchanted by the Cecil. In August 1902 no less a worthy than <span className="font-semibold">Mr. James M. S. Langerman</span>, who was on a diplomatic mission to persuade the Sultan of Morocco to participate at the St. Louis World Fair, booked into the hotel. His arrival was eagerly reported in <span className="italic">Al-Moghreb Al-Aksa</span>:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "Mr. James M. S. Langerman, Vice-Consul General of the United States of America, and Commissioner General of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, accompanied by Mrs. Langerman, arrived here last Thursday and are staying at the Hotel Cecil."
          </blockquote>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In a follow-on report published in the same journal in December 1902 its readers learned that:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "Mr. Langerman was received by His Majesty the Sultan on Monday evening the 8th instant at the Shereefian Camp, near Fez, whence he was escorted by 20 horsemen expressly sent for that purpose. Mr. Langerman has been commissioned to obtain His Majesty's consent to have a proper exhibit of Moroccan products, arts, industry, etc., at the Louisiana Exhibition. We understand that he is quiet confident of the final success of the Moroccan session in the magnificent World's Fair."
          </blockquote>

          <div className="bg-amber-50 p-8 my-8 border-l-4 border-amber-600">
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Mr. Langerman finally booked out of the Cecil in January 1904: "confident that the Moroccan section in the St. Louis Exhibition will constitute the best foundation for future commerce between the United States and Morocco, thus strengthening the ties of friendship and cordial relations happily existing between the two countries."
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm italic">
              It was as well that the hotel boasted its own stable block for the departing diplomat took with him "four beautiful Barbary horses he lately bought from Fez, three of which, with magnificent saddles, were presented to him by His Majesty the Sultan."

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Langerman's diplomatic mission, to encourage the Sultan to authorize Moroccan participation at the St. Louis World fair, was indicative that, like it or not, the Shereefian Empire was about to undergo forcible modernisation. The French government had already embarked upon a policy of 'political penetration' or, more accurately, a creeping economic colonization which culminated, in 1912, in the country being effectively partitioned into French and Spanish 'protectorates'.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It is interesting to speculate whether Langerman met a certain <span className="font-semibold">Monsieur Hermand</span>, a shadowy individual, perhaps an agent of French intelligence, who was very much to the fore in realizing the political objectives of the Third Republic. We know, from an entry in <span className="italic">Al-Moghreb Al-Aksa</span>, that he was actually a guest at the Cecil during Langerman's stay, and it is entirely possible that he accompanied the Vice-Consul on his visit to Fez:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "Monsieur Hermand, a French electrical engineer, who lately returned from Fez, is staying at the Hotel Cecil, and will shortly proceed to Rabat on a commission to establish wireless telegraphy in this country."

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Churchill Mystery</h3>

            <h4 className="text-amber-400 text-xl mb-4">Was Winston Churchill a Guest?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              An as yet unresolved question is whether or not <span className="font-semibold">Sir Winston Churchill, K.G.</span>, was once a guest at the Cecil. In April 1901 the <span className="italic">AL-MOGHREB AL-AKSA</span> referred to a 'Mr. Churchill' who had just booked into the hotel.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Elected as the Member of Parliament for Oldham in 1900, parliament would have been in recess for the Easter holiday in April 1901, the very period of the mysterious Mr. Churchill's visit to the hotel. Unfortunately, as neither the guests Christian-name not initials were published, it is impossible to establish if this entry is a reference to Britain's famous World War II Prime Minister or not.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              However, considering other factors, political as well as social, he may well have been. Churchill was keenly interested in the 'Moroccan Question', and particularly in the French, Spanish, and Kaiser William II's colonial designs on the country, which threatened Gibraltar and hence British Naval supremacy in the Mediterranean! He might well have paid a low-key visit to Tangier, the better to access the political situation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Churchill was also a friend and pupil of Sir John Lavery, the Irish society painter, who was certainly a patron of the Cecil in 1906. Furthermore Sir Winston made several later trips to Tangier during the late 1940s and 1950s when he was a client of the Hotel Rif, a few hundred yards distance from the Cecil which, by then, had ceased to be considered fashionable.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            On balance it is entirely possible that Sir Winston Churchill was infact one of the Cecil's earliest patrons.
