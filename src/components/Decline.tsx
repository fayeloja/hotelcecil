            Although, at the time, the change in management might have seemed much the less important event, the editor of <span className="italic">THE TANGIER GAZETTE</span> had some inkling of its real import and clearly foresaw the potential damage it might cause:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "October 18th 1930, It is with great regret that we hear that Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien are leaving the Cecil Hotel this week. Mrs. O'Brien has for so many years done so much to make the Hotel a success that it will require a strong personality to retain the position. We understand that Senor Don Marchena is to act as director, La Senora Marchena being the heiress of the late Mr. Eugene Chapory."
          </blockquote>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The O'Brien Departure</h3>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It is impossible to discover eighty years after this event why the efficient Mr.O'Brien and his socially popular wife resigned as directors of the Cecil after "many years", but one might posit that they were 'head-hunted' by the Bute family!
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            There is evidence to suggest this. In 1923 <span className="font-semibold">Lord Colum Crichton-Stuart, M.P.</span>, for Cheshire, the younger brother of the 4th Marquess of Bute, founder of the El Minzah, was listed as a guest at the Cecil. He undoubtedly met Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien and as, even then, his brother was planning the construction of the El Minzah, and noting just how professional and socially popular the couple was, he may have decided to poach them.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-gray-700 italic">
              What is indisputable is that within a few months of leaving the Cecil the O'Briens were appointed as directors of the Grand Hotel Villa Valentina, part of Bute's Rentistica Group.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Rise of the Villa Valentina</h3>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Given the couple's social skills and popularity, especially among the members of the British Colony, they were able to attract to the Villa Valentina the patronage of many of the Cecil's most valued customers and societies. Thus, for example, the Tangier Hunt Ball, in January 1932, was held not in the Cecil but at the Villa Valentina.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Mrs. O'Brien seems to have been particularly well liked by Tangier Society and in press references to events held in the Valentina she was frequently singled out for praise:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "April 23, 1932, a dance was given in aid of the funds for the Peoples' Dispensary for Sick Animals at the Hotel Valentina on the 14th instant. It was a great success and much enjoyed by all present. The Committee of the P. D. S. A. desire to accord their warmest thanks to Mrs. O'Brien who organized matters so excellently."
          </blockquote>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It was doubtless Mrs. O'Brien who gained for the Valentina the patronage of the British Women's Association, Tangier Friends of Music, and the Oversea's League. She seemed irrepressibly inventive in promoting the hotel even using her membership of the Tangier branch of the Tail-Waggers' Club to do so:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-white p-8 my-8 border border-gray-200">
            <blockquote className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed italic">
              "We are informed that the Tail Waggers' Club has already passed the half million mark on the British register. But there still exist another 3 million dogs in Great Britain that have not yet joined the Club. We wonder how many Tail-Waggers there are in Tangier? Mrs. O'Brien, the popular manageress of the Hotel Villa Valentina, has the distinction of her dog Ju Ju, bearing the sign No. 1 on its medal. The subscription to the Tail-Waggers' Club is half a crown per annum per dog. Subscriptions may be sent to Mrs. O'Brien, c/o the Hotel Villa Valentina."
            </blockquote>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Innovative Management</h3>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Mrs. O'Brien not only excelled in manipulating the local press but was also an intelligent business woman and innovative manageress. In December 1932, according to a report in <span className="italic">THE TANGIER GAZETTE</span>, a Boxing Day Ball was held at the Valentina "by the popular management, Mr. and Mrs. T. Q. O'Brien and the guests, who were many, came early and stayed late, and there was a general consensus that not for a long day had a jollier show been held in Tangier."
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shortly thereafter she began to give Moorish Dinners at the hotel. The first of these, held in October, 1933 was attended by:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "nearly 60 persons (who) took their seats – some with difficulty, for it is not easy to sit cross-legged when one has passed the first flush of youth! The ballroom had been tastefully arranged by Mrs. O'Brien with long divans having in front of them low tables on which the Moorish food was served . . . An additional touch of colour was given to an already bright and animated scene by the presence of a Moorish maiden dressed in all her resplendent robes. The dinner was followed by a dance in the ballroom, and the whole night's entertainment was voted by all those present to be a great success."
          </blockquote>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Continuing her triumph, the indefatigable Mrs. O'Brien gave another ball in March 1933 at which, "by kind permission of Rear-Admiral James, the band of H.M.S. Hood will play. Admission by invitation only."
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Complete Eclipse</h3>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The O'Briens proved so successful at the Valentina that in February 1934 they were appointed joint-managers of Lord Bute's Grand Hotel Villa de France. By that date no reference to, or advertisement for, the Cecil had appeared in <span className="italic">THE TANGIER GAZETTE</span> since the O'Briens had left its employment.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-gray-900 text-white p-8 my-12">
            <h4 className="text-amber-400 text-xl mb-4">The Marchena Failure</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Their successors, the Marchenas, appear to have been complete business failures and social non-entities to boot. They no longer published the hotel's guest list in the local press, a mistake the O'Briens did not make, carefully submitting the Valentina's weekly to <span className="italic">THE TANGIER GAZETTE</span>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              The O'Briens relentlessly advertised the hotel's facilities and their own management: "Grand Hotel Valentina. A first class All-British hotel, management Mr. and Mrs. T. Q. Brien, thoroughly modernized, all bedrooms fitted hot and cold water, rooms with private baths, self-contained suites, Moorish and English lounges, card room, large terrace, sheltered garden, billiards, ballroom, ping pong, tennis, the most attractive American bar in Morocco, excellent cuisine, open to non-residents."

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Whilst the Cecil stagnated under the mismanagement of the Marchenas, the El Minzah went from strength to strength! It too proved innovative in the services it provided to its clients. In 1933 it opened an art gallery, under the management of Monsieur Marcel Levy, which held regular exhibitions and shortly thereafter it began to host weekly Sunday tea dances.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Its partner hotel, the Villa de France, under the O'Briens, boasted a ladies' hairdresser offering the "latest and best permanent waving, for One Pound One Shilling." (the equivalent of 150€ in today's values).
          </p>

          <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-600 p-8 my-12">
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              By the mid 1930s the Hotel Cecil, which less than a decade earlier had counted the cream of European society amongst its clientele, had been completely eclipsed. From the departure of the O'Briens in October 1930 until December 1935 it failed to be mentioned even once in the columns of <span className="italic">THE TANGIER GAZETTE</span>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Neither was in mentioned in a survey of the selected years 1940, 1945, 1950 or 1955. Quite simply the Cecil simply ceased to exist so far as 'International Society' was concerned.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Tragically, what had once been one of the great institutions of Tangier, the favoured venue for the <span className="italic">'grande monde'</span>, went into a prolonged decline from which it emerged, in the 1960s, as just another non-descript Tangier tourist hotel.
