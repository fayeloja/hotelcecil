          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For more than two centuries the British military class has been closely associated with the Freemason movement and thus, given that the Cecil had acquired the character of a military club, it is hardly surprising that the hotel played an important role in the establishment of Freemasonry in Morocco.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            There had been an earlier attempt, in 1882, to found a Lodge in Tangier. According to a brief article in <span className="italic">THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS</span> the Al-Moghreb Al-Aksa Lodge was established in that year in the White City by two Muslims, three Jews, four Spanish Roman Catholics (who were automatically excommunicated from their Church), and several English and Canadian Protestants resident in Gibraltar! The Lodge appears to have failed within a decade.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In 1902 a second and more successful attempt was made to constitute a Tangier Lodge. According to an article published in <span className="italic">AL-MOGHREB AL-AKSA</span> on August 23rd 1902:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-amber-600 pl-6 my-6 italic text-gray-600">
              "A large number of Freemasons arrived this afternoon by the S.S. Gibel Tarik for the purpose of the consecration of a lodge S.C at the Hotel Cecil."

            <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm italic">
              It was typical of the discretion of the hotel management, and the anonymity preserved by Freemasons, that the guest list was not published in that week's edition of the local newspaper!

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If Freemasonry may be considered a sort of pseudo religion of 'occultist universalism' the Cecil was no less popular with more bona fide clergymen. According to an article published in <span className="italic">AL-MOGHREB AL-AKSA</span> on December 2nd. 1905, the <span className="font-semibold">Rt. Reverend Dr Collins, Bishop of Gibraltar</span> in Europe arrived in Tangier "aboard His Majesty's Torpedo Boat, No. 96" in order to consecrate the recently completed Saint Andrew's Anglican Church.

              "The Reverend and Mrs. More were 'at home' at the Hotel Cecil on Monday afternoon when a large number of the British community was invited to meet the Lord Bishop of Gibraltar. From 4.30 p.m. a constant stream of visitors arrived, everyone being evidently anxious to take the rare opportunity afforded them of meeting together. Mr. and Mrs. Moore, with the Bishop, received their guests in the Drawing Room, where each of them was introduced to his Lordship who charmed everyone with his kindly and gracious manner, and contributed so very much to the success and enjoyment of the afternoon."
