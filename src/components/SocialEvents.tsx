            The elegance of the Cecil made it a very desirable venue for social events. According to Philip Abensur, <span className="italic">'TANGIER ENTRE ORIENT ET OCCIDENT'</span>, 2009, at a banquet given in the hotel by the Commission of Hygiene (a body which subsequenly developed into the Legislative Council of the Tangier International Zone) the lavish menu included:

            Doubtlessly it was the skill of the hotel's chefs which made its restaurant one of the most popular in Tangier. A glowing report published in <span className="italic">THE TANGIER GAZETTE</span> on December 24th 1924 certainly stressed the delights of dining à la Cecil:

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "The excellent fare offered by the Hotel Cecil on Christmas Day encouraged several people to give dinner parties there. Over 60 people sat down to dinner which was accompanied by much laughter and fun. The evening ended with a dance which was very well attended and much enjoyed. The Hotel was splendidly decorated and the large fires and tastefully shaded lights helped to produce a very charming effect."

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Several prestigious local societies including the British Chamber of Commerce, the Drag Hounds and the Tangier Hunt patronized the Cecil. Perhaps the Swansong of its heyday as the city's most fashionable hotel was the Hunt Ball which it hosted in April, 1930:

            <blockquote className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed italic">
              "Last Tuesday night at the Cecil Hotel a Hunt Ball was given as the coming out party of the newly formed Hunt Club, and partly as a means for collecting funds for the maintenance of the Tangier Hounds, which have hitherto been supported by private subscription only. The Drawing Room of the Hotel was cleared for dancing, and as was most appropriate, hung with bridles, polo sticks, etc., and a few saddles were variously disposed about the room. Music was dispensed by a string orchestra who played extraordinarily well, not only the Fox Trot and Waltzes, but also Paul Jones and Strip the Willow, both of which dances proved to be very good fun and greatly enjoyed.

            <blockquote className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed italic mt-4">
              An appetizing selection of cakes and sandwiches were laid out in the dining room with cup of two kinds to wash them down. The ball finished at One, rather an early hour seemingly for Tangier, but this time was fixed out of consideration for those who were going out Pig-sticking camp on the following day. A most successful show and very well attended by the English colony as well as certain officers from H.M.S. Tourmaline and H.M.S. Splendid anchored in the Bay."

              The same edition of <span className="italic">THE TANGIER GAZETTE</span> which reported the Hunt Ball carried an advertisement which announced the forthcoming opening of the Hotel El Minzah. Two events which occurred almost simultaneously augured the rapid eclipse of the Cecil as Tangier's leading hotel: the first was the opening the Lord Bute's luxurious El Minzah, and the second, no less important, was a change in management.

            On April 9, 1947, in an ironic twist, the British owned hotel, which had hosted many European statesmen through its doors, welcomed <span className="font-semibold">Sultan Mohammed V</span>. He came to Tangier to make his historic speech at Grand Socco (now called Place du 9 Avril 1947) calling for Moroccan independence.
