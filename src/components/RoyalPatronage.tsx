          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Just how rapidly the Cecil acquired such a reputation is underlined by the fact that within a year of opening it counted <span className="font-semibold">H.R.H. Prince Henri d'Orleans</span>, among its guests. Prince Henri d'Orleans (1867-1901) was the son of H.R.H. Prince Louis Philippe, Duc d'Orleans, and the grandson of His Majesty King Louis-Philippe I of the French.

            A distinguished traveler and explorer he discovered the source of the Irrawaddy and was the recipient of the gold medal of the Geographic Society of Paris in 1890. He died, unmarried, a few months after leaving Tangier, at Saigon on August 9th 1901.

              The very fact that Prince Henri had been a guest in the Cecil gave it an undeniable cachet in high Society.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For several decades the hotel was patronized by the bluest blood of Europe. In 1907, for example, the guests included <span className="font-semibold">H.R.H. Princess Margaret Mathilde of Saxony</span> (1863-1933), the daughter of His Majesty King George I of Saxony, and sister of King Friedrich-August III. Her visit was eagerly reported in <span className="italic">Al Moghreb Al-Aksa</span> in the April 6th 1907 issue:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-600">
            "Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret Mathilde, sister of His Majesty the King of Saxony, and suite, arrived this morning from Seville, via Algeciras, for a short stay at the Hotel Cecil. Her Royal Highness was received at the pier by His Excellency Dr Rosen, German Minister, and other members of the Imperial German Legation."

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Exactly one week later <span className="font-semibold">Her Highness Princess Schronburg of Saxony</span> also reserved rooms in the Cecil, as did several Spanish Grandees:

          </ul>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It is not unlikely that the German Princesses' visits to the White City had been inspired, at least in part, by the Emperor William II of Germany's dramatic, politically motivated, saber rattling visit to Tangier the preceding year.

            The very fact that the Cecil was patronized by people of such high status in European aristocratic Society had the effect of popularizing the hotel among their peer group. By the 1920s, the hotel's guest register read like a who's who of European nobility, including:
